# C

Done: Yes

## **introduction**

 dennis retchie in 1972 inverts c language, cpu is the responsible of perform your task 

## **low level Vs high level**

## **what is low level language ?**

- it has abstraction percentage low for computer (computer can understand this language with out compiler ).
- example about low level languages are assembly && machine language
  
    ## **low level features ?**
    
    - great for os/firmware.
    - complete control
    - ability to edit on memory
    
    ## **low level disadvantages ?**
    
    - difficult to use.
    - longer development time.
    
    ## **what is high level language ?**
    
    - it has abstraction percentage high for computer (computer cannot understand this language with out compiler ).
    - example about high level languages are python, c, java&& c++.
    - the first high level languages like cobol, fortran (introduced in 1950’s)
    
    ## **high level features ?**
    
    - programmers doesn't have to think for register or memory management, instead function, objects&& garbage collector.
    - simple to use.
    - independent of architecture.

## **How can computer perform your c code**

step 1 : transfer c code to computer code 

step 2 : transfer computer code to extension file 

## **variables**

**variables**: is the container that you can storage your data type in it like text, character and number, etc...

**rules to write a variables correctly**>> Any variable in the world contain the 3 step: 

step 1 : write the data that the variable will return value to you 

step 2 : write the data name 

step 3 : write the semicolon in the end or in the any instruction 

## **Data types**

**the Basic data types in c :** 

1. int>>>>integer variables 
2. float >>>> decimal variables 
3. double>>> can contain a lot of data much from float <;    
4. char >>>> single character 
5. string >>> can contain a lot of characters 

## **printf >>> instruction**

the Goal of use printf function is print what do you want appear to the user && can use format specifier to appear what do you want with easily method .

## **fgets**

take the strings (the last name && the second name ) 

## **Arrays**

Arrays: storage a lot of variables in the same place 

arrays >>element from 1 && index>>from  0 

## **structs**

**data structure’s benefit** : you can collect some  different data type by using data struct .  

## **Rang**

to calculate the rang: use this formula>>-(2^n-1) to ((2^n-1)-1) 

to calculate the rang for unsigned : use this formula>>(0 to (2^n)-1) 

## **loops**

repetition statement have 3 types in all language are while , do-while , for 

before any thing we should use counter which a numeric (float - integer - double) 

 

## **complexity**

- best case
- average case
- worst  case
- big o
