## why you like to learning c++ ??

because i want to learn about programming , it is my job and i want to be a great in this field . 

------------

### The concepts in this course : 

1. introduction to c++ . 
2. what is source code , object code , compiler , algorithm ? 
3. introduction to  variables .

----------------------------

### 1.introduction to c++ . 

### what is c++ ? 

#### c++ is used in general purpose : 

- create all types of programs : games , operating systems , browser , compilers , embedded systems , all others general purpose software . 

#### compiled  :

- converting code that you understand into code that your computer understands .
- building code . 
- compile-time errors . 

#### case sensitive : 

- c++ distinguishes between upper case and lower case letters . 
- my variable != My Variable . 

## why c++ was created ? 

- because it is understandable and easy to use fast execution of demanding tasks . 

------------

## 2.what is source code , object code , compiler , algorithm ? 

- source code =compiler=> machine code . 

### source code: 

- is the base code or the simple form from code and it can be able pseudocode or c++ code . 

### object code : 

- usually is form of ones or zeros  , the computers can understand it . 

### algorithms : 

- algorithms is list of ingredients and steps that the computer needs to do your orders . 

-------

## 3.introduction to  variables : 

- you can get rid the junk text in your command by 

```c++
system("pause>0") ; 
```

------

## complete course c++: 

### to learn the max integer can understand in int or any data type 

```c++
in generall => -2^(n-1) and 2^(n-1)-1 
 int => -2^(32-1) and 2^(32-1)-1 
  if the data type is unsigned => 2^(32)-1 
      32-1 عشان فيه واحد بت للاشاره 
      
```

```c++
wchar_t x = 't' ; == char x = 't'  ;
but the different is the wchar take much memory to save the character 
```

```c++
auto result = a + b+ c ; 
// must on the same line 
typeid(YourVariable).name() => to know the datatype of your variable .. 
decltype(yourvariableYouWant) variableName = value => if you want to declare variable be the same type of another variable .. 
```

```
0xhexnumber or 0bbinar
std::hex => to print hex number .
```

```c++
to create ptr in dynamic memory : int * dnumber = new int[1] ;
but you must delete the variable by use delete dnumber or if is array delete[] arrayname
```
