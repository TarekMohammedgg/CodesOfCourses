### 1.introduction to c++ . 

### what is c++ ? 

#### c++ is used in general purpose : 

- create all types of programs : games , operating systems , browser , compilers , embedded systems , all others general purpose software . 

#### compiled  :

- converting code that you understand into code that your computer understands .
- building code . 
- compile-time errors . 

#### case sensitive : 

- c++ distinguishes between upper case and lower case letters . 
- my variable != My Variable . 

## why c++ was created ? 

- because it is understandable and easy to use fast execution of demanding tasks . 

------------

## 2.what is source code , object code , compiler , algorithm ? 

- source code =compiler=> machine code . 

### source code: 

- is the base code or the simple form from code and it can be able pseudocode or c++ code . 

### object code : 

- usually is form of ones or zeros  , the computers can understand it . 

### algorithms : 

- algorithms is list of ingredients and steps that the computer needs to do your orders .

## 3.introduction to  variables : 

- you can get rid the junk text in your command by 

```c++
system("pause>0") ;
