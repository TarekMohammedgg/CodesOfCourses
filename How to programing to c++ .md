## introduction to computer science and c++ 

### 1.3hardware and software :

* abundant => silicon is one of the most abundant (وفرة | متوفرة )materials on earth..

* commodity => the computers have become a commodity(سلعة ) . 

* Moor is create Intel processor ... 

  

### 1.3.2computer organization : 

* shipping => output unit is shipping section ... 

  

### 1.4Data hierarchy : 

* bits (0 or 1 ) => characters(group of bits (bytes)) => fields => files => Data base => Big Data (Data composed every day) . 

  

### 1.5machine languages , Assembly languages and high level languages : 

* cumbersome => such languages are cumbersome (مرهق | متعب )for humans ...
* tedious => machine languages was simply too slow and tedious (شاق) for most programmers .. 
* abbreviations : the abbreviations (اختصار )forms the basis of assembly languages .

assembly-languages => assemblers => machine-language 

High level-languages => compilers | interpreters => machine-code

interpreter slowly than compiler ... 

### 1.6 c and c++ 

c was implemented in 1972 by  "Dennis Ritchie" . 

c++ , an extension of c, was developed by "Bjarne Stroustrup" in 1979 originally called "c with classes " . 

** you can look at software reuse and c++ standard library on google ** 

* approach => building-block approach (يقترب من | منهج )to create a program .

*  reinventing => Avoid reinventing (اعادة اختراع )the wheel .
* portal / portability => portability (منفذ | قابل للتنقل )tips .

* contemporary => swift is the contemporary (معاصرة )language . 
* scale / enterprise => java is used to develop large scale (نطاق ) enterprise(مشروع | مغامرة) applications 

java according write one "any where "  feature by using jvm "java virtual machine " . 

### 1.8 introduction to object technology : 

*  elusive => building software quickly correctly and economically remains an elusive (صعب المنال )goal at a time . 
* instantiation => you must instantiation (تجسيد)your good notes . 

### 1.9 Typical c++ Development Environment : 

c++ system generally consist of : 

1.  A program development environment 
2. language c++ and standard library 
3. six phrases (edit , preprocess , compile {create object code and store it on your disk } , link , load and execute)

##### linking in c++ : 

link the objects code with the libraries creates and executable file and stores it on disk .

##### loading : 

Before a program can be executed , you must first be placed in **memory** this is done by the loader . 

##### execution : 

under control of it is cpu , execute the program one instruction at a time , some modern computer often execute several instruction in parallel . 

##### c++ standard : 

1. output stream (cout) . 
2. input stream (cin) . 
3. error stream (cerr) --> used for displaying error messages . 

### 1.10.1 compiling and Runing an applications in visual studio 2015 for windows : 

* assume : we assume (يفترض )that you have already the book . 
* convenient : software system that make using computers more convenient (مناسب )for users .

### 1.11.1 

android by google operating system based on linux and java and is open source . 

!! from page 76 to 80 . 

### 1.12 The internet and the world wide web: 

* adjust : A smart thermostats that adjust ( يعدل ) room temperatures based on weather of forecasts(تنؤ)  and activity in the home . 

### 1.13 some key software Development terminology . 

* involves : Refactoring involves reworking programs to make  clearer and easier to maintain .

### 2.1 introduction : 

* dem.on.strate (verb) : demonstrate(يوضح بدليل) decision making by compare two numbers .

```c++
/*# => meaning are processed by the preprocess before the program is compiled ..*/
// \r "carriage return" => it make like overriding the current line of the terminal . 
// example: cout<< "i like " <<"\r" << "programming"<<endl ;
// the output is : programming 

```
